It's January 2026. You've just rolled over into a new year, and like every developer with a Hacker News account, you've made The List.

You know the one. The annual catalog of technical self-improvement promises that you're *definitely* going to follow through on this time. Unlike last year. And the year before that.

Here are the greatest hits, ranked by how quickly they'll collapse.

### 1. "This Is the Year I Learn Rust"

**Expected Duration**: 3 weeks

Every year, thousands of developers download the Rust compiler, work through the first three chapters of *The Rust Book*, get confused by lifetimes, and quietly give up.

You tell yourself it's because you're "too busy." The real reason is that Rust makes you feel stupid in ways JavaScript never did. Your brain, accustomed to the comforting chaos of `undefined is not a function`, recoils at borrow checker error messages that sound like you've personally offended the compiler.

By February, you're back to writing Node.js APIs and occasionally retweeting Rust evangelists to maintain the illusion that you care.

**Actual Outcome**: The Rust compiler remains installed but unused. You'll uninstall it in April to free up disk space.

### 2. "I'm Going to Write Tests for Everything"

**Expected Duration**: 1 sprint

This is the resolution of the guilty. You *know* you should write tests. Everyone says so. Your tech lead mentions it in every retro. That one blog post you read was very convincing.

So you start strong. You write unit tests for your new feature. You even hit 80% coverage. You feel virtuous.

Then a deadline hits. "I'll add tests after the release," you say. The release goes out. You never add the tests. The next feature ships without tests too. And the next one.

By February, you're back to `console.log()` debugging and praying nothing breaks in production.

**Actual Outcome**: That one test file from January remains in the repo, giving the illusion of a tested codebase. It's a lie.

### 3. "I Will Document My Code Properly"

**Expected Duration**: 2 weeks

Documentation is one of those things everyone agrees is important but nobody actually does. This year will be different, you promise yourself. Meaningful commit messages. README files that actually explain how things work. Inline comments that aren't just `// TODO: fix this later`.

Week 1: You write beautiful, detailed documentation for a new module. It's comprehensive. It's clear. You're basically a technical writer now.

Week 2: You update the README for another project. It's shorter, but still decent.

Week 3: You write `// wtf is this doing???` above a function you don't understand and call it a day.

By February, your commit messages have regressed to "fix," "wip," and "asdfasdf."

**Actual Outcome**: The only documentation that exists is that one README you wrote in January. It's now out of date.

### 4. "No More Side Projects Until I Finish the Current One"

**Expected Duration**: Until the next cool idea (approximately 10 days)

You have 47 unfinished side projects. This year, you're going to be disciplined. You're going to finish *one thing* before starting another.

January 5th: You're making excellent progress on your HomeKit automation dashboard.

January 15th: You see a cool post about building a CLI tool in Go. "Just a quick experiment," you tell yourself.

January 22nd: You're now rewriting your entire homelab infrastructure in Terraform because you read a blog post about infrastructure-as-code.

February 1st: All three projects are abandoned. You're researching embedded systems because someone on Twitter said Raspberry Pi Picos are cool.

**Actual Outcome**: 50 unfinished side projects. The guilt intensifies.

### 5. "I'm Going to Stop Using Stack Overflow and Actually Understand Things"

**Expected Duration**: 4 hours

This is the resolution of the idealist. You're tired of copy-pasting code you don't understand. This year, you're going to read the documentation. You're going to truly *learn* the fundamentals.

9:00 AM: You encounter a bug. You open the official docs.

9:30 AM: The docs are confusing. You still don't understand the problem.

10:00 AM: You Google the error message. The first result is a Stack Overflow answer from 2014.

10:02 AM: You copy-paste the solution. It works. You move on.

**Actual Outcome**: Stack Overflow remains your primary learning resource. You'll try this again next year.

### 6. "I Will Wake Up Early and Code Before Work"

**Expected Duration**: 3 days

Inspired by some productivity guru on YouTube, you decide to become a morning person. You'll wake up at 5 AM, make coffee, and get in two solid hours of focused coding before your day job.

Day 1: You wake up at 5 AM. You're exhausted. You code for 20 minutes, then doomscroll Twitter for 90 minutes.

Day 2: You wake up at 5:30 AM. Close enough. You write a few lines of code, then fall asleep on your keyboard.

Day 3: Your alarm goes off. You snooze it. You wake up at 8:45 AM, late for work.

**Actual Outcome**: You're back to coding at 11 PM in bed, same as always.

### 7. "I'm Going to Contribute to Open Source"

**Expected Duration**: Until you read a project's CONTRIBUTING.md

You've been *using* open source for years. It's time to give back. You'll find a project, fix some bugs, submit PRs. How hard can it be?

You pick a popular repo. You read the contributing guidelines. There's a 47-step process involving linting, testing, signing a CLA, running pre-commit hooks, and adhering to a commit message format that requires a PhD to understand.

You find a typo in the README. You think about fixing it. You close the tab.

**Actual Outcome**: You star the repo and never think about it again.

### The Only Resolution That Works

Here's the thing about New Year's resolutions: they fail because they're based on the fantasy version of yourself. The you who has infinite willpower, no distractions, and a burning passion for writing unit tests.

That person doesn't exist.

The real you is tired. Busy. Easily distracted by new shiny tech. And you know what? That's fine.

So here's my only resolution for 2026: **Be okay with not being perfect.**

Didn't learn Rust? Cool. Maybe you learned something else. Didn't write tests? At least the feature shipped. Didn't finish your side project? You had fun starting it, and that counts for something.

The tech industry loves the myth of the relentlessly self-improving 10x developer. But most of us are just trying to get through the day without breaking production.

And honestly? That's enough.

*P.S. - I'm definitely going to learn Rust this year. For real this time. I'm very serious.*
